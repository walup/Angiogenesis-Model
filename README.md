# Angiogenesis-Model

Implementation of a Post-angiogenic model for tumor growth, which was used to investigate how vascular network properties influenced cancer development and therapy prognosis.

Angiogenesis model was based on the one presented by Anderson and Chaplain:

The model was adapted and docked to our previously developed tumor growth and therapy model. 




For code use consult examples illustrated in the notebook for the time being. I will provide examples for code-usage and results that can be obtained with the model on future updates of this repository.
